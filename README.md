# Python Basics Learning

Welcome to my Python basics learning repository! This repository is a comprehensive record of my journey in mastering Python programming, starting with fundamental concepts and progressing to advanced topics. It includes practice scripts, exercises, and examples to reinforce learning.

## Topics Covered
This repository covers a wide range of Python programming topics, including:

- **Python Fundamentals**: Introduction to Python, syntax, and basic operations.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding Python's core data types (int, float, string, boolean, etc.) and working with variables.
- **Control Flow**: Writing conditional statements (if-else, elif) and loops (for, while) to control program execution.
- **Functions**: Creating reusable blocks of code using arguments, return statements, and lambda functions.
- **Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Understanding classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **File Handling**: This includes reading from and writing to files, working with file modes, and managing file paths.
- **Error Handling**: Using try-except blocks to handle exceptions and ensure robust code execution.
- **Data Structures**: 
  - **Lists**: Creating, accessing, and manipulating list elements.
  - **Tuples**: Using immutable sequences.
  - **Dictionaries**: Working with key-value pairs for efficient data storage.
  - **Sets**: Understanding unique, unordered collections.
- **Modules and Packages**: Using Python's standard library and creating custom modules and packages.
- **String Manipulation**: Formatting, slicing, and processing strings effectively.
- **List Comprehensions**: Writing concise and efficient list operations.
- **Iterators and Generators**: Understanding how to use and create iterators and generators for efficient looping.
- **Decorators**: Enhancing functions using Python's decorator syntax.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Pattern matching and text processing using the `re` module.
- **Basics of Python Libraries**: Introduction to popular Python libraries like `math`, `os`, and `datetime`.
